    <div class="flex-parent">
        <div class="flex-child" style=" overflow: scroll;">
            <span>This Is a Critique</span> is a move to confront the eurocentric, male-
            centered critique culture and erasure of women of color (WOC) in the Graphic Design department at RISD. It is located in the main hallway entrance of the Design Center from May 10–May 23 2021.
            The installation acts as a space for the voices of WOC to freely speak in an institution where we have traditionally been erased or silenced. It acts 
            to highlight and reveal the structures at play to those who 
            are and have been complicit. <br><br>
            <span>Included in both the installation and this accompanying zine are the stories and experiences of 14 anonymous WOC in RISD GD.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-child" >
            I keep thinking about what it means to be a WOC in this institution
            instilled with patriarchal and 
            Western (Northern European) 
            values, and my thoughts keep going back to the expectation of work: work above and beyond what is asked of my male counterparts to even just be known by my name; work above and beyond my non-
            BIPOC peers to frame and reframe and recontextualize for the system I have been dropped into; work that is added to my load when my peers 
            refuse to contribute in a way that feeds back into the community 
            (unless it serves themselves). 
            I think the first four weeks of the last semester of my BFA education have been fruitful. I’ve gotten a lot of work done. I am so grateful to have been given the opportunity to do it because I enjoy being able to help others. Through it all, I feel so grateful to have received support and to see how I can support those around me. 
            <br><br>
            However, I am also looking back 
            at the sheer amount of work that 
            I had to do to even receive these opportunities — and through that I remember that I am a body that is deemed lesser in the context of the institution I attend, and the society we live in. So, I am tired. 
            I think about the idea of giving and taking within the structure of coloniality a lot. It’s probably because my entire childhood was spent in spaces that were colonized. Inherent to the system of colonization is that the people in power take from those being colonized. They take resources, take advantage of generosity, take 
            the validity and voice from the colonized. On the other hand, those who have been colonized are expected to constantly give. Give space and time for the imposition that the colonizers make upon them culturally, physically and historically. Within the institutional context of the critique space this idea of give and take is activated. 
            <br><br>
            Over time, I have noticed that there are small groups of students (more 
            often than not composed of cis straight males) who actively disengage from their peers’ work. Around themselves they have built a system of elitism and exclusivity. There is an expectation on their end for all other students to give them time, give them opinions, give them feedback to continue building. But when the coin is flipped they sit in silence. They do not give, they only take. This kind of behavior may seem passive in the moment, however, it is an active engagement in a system of oppression. 
            Society expects WOC to input an insane amount of work towards just being seen, a (seemingly small, but actually impactful) privilege that the men in our spaces benefit from. The silence that these cis straight men engage in takes advantage of this privilege as they take resources and energy from their peers without giving back, thus, putting them at a direct advantage over their peers who are expending energy to give and take simultaneously. The sentiment of power hierarchies and advantages that come into play in this kind of behaviour harkens back to those within colonization. Never did I expect to step into an educational discussion space and to experience these colonial-like exchanges.
            On March 16th 2021, there was a shooting. 6 women of Asian descent were killed in a massage parlor in Georgia. My parents called me that day astutely telling me to take more care than usual. This message parsed out to more than just my engagement in public spaces. 
            The very next day, I was in a critique space. A cis white male student had made a piece of work that could possibly offend or harm others. A fellow Asian female peer in my class decided to speak out and warn about how this might negatively impact the intended audience of the work. 
            <br><br>
            The student responded with “Well that’s your opinion, I don’t really care if I offend anyone, I think it’s funny” as if that would make it okay. The students in the room who looked and sounded like him nodded their heads in agreement. 
            No, it’s not okay. To completely invalidate and not acknowledge a voice in a room that does not reflect your own is not okay. The lack of consideration and the closing of space is not okay. 
            It is an act of dehumanization and a lessening of the worth of one’s peers. It was an act that was especially harmful after the killings and media response that devalued the lives of Asian-Americans only the day before. 
            To make it worse, our professors did not back up nor acknowledge the opinion of the student of colour in the room, instead they validated and coddled the man who had devalued her opinion. 
            <br><br>
            After speaking to the others in that space, I know for a fact that every other person who did not fall into the category of a cis straight white male felt uncomfortable, unsupported, and unseen by those in authority in this moment. I thought to myself: this is a critique?
            This is simply one event from one perspective, however, it is not an 
            isolated occurrence. It is entangled in a web of oppression and bias. 
            I have listened to so many instances where my peers are harmed by these systems that exist in the structure of our critical spaces. Moments of 
            invalidation, oppression, and 
            erasure are completely unacceptable and yet we are expected to continue enduring them. It’s so emotionally draining to have to deal with alongside all the other work that we are expected to do. It is unfair and disadvantageous. Those involved must be held accountable whether they are our professors or our peers. 
            <br><br>
            There must be times when we stop in the moment and talk about the behaviours and structures that we are all participating in, and ask for empathy and care from all those around us. 
            Those involved must acknowledge the harm they have done and put in the necessary work to understand. 
            It is unacceptable to ask those  who are othered to do the work of meeting those in power (and privilege) where they stand. Instead, those with power should take the step of putting in the effort to move  towards those around them who are marginalized.
            This is a critique of the educational institution. This is a critique of the immediate happenings I have seen around me. This is a critique happening at RISD, but it also must happen everywhere else.

                Mind your own business and learn to humble yourself to be open to other

                <p class="listen">All the occasions of erasure have conglomerated into a blurred memory of passing micro-aggressions and being talked over. I spent a whole semester making work about my Asian American identity only to be told by my professor in our final review that she never was that interested in identity work. 
                </p>
                <p>The fact that most students and faculty aren’t equipped with the resources or knowledge to even approach WOC’s work is disheartening and invalidating. I haven’t gotten a single piece of meaningful feedback about my personal work because critique always ends up being more about the form/technique rather than my concepts. 
                    On occasion, that lack of knowledge also manifests in complete disregard for WOC’s lived experiences, trauma, and complexity. I think this is also definitely a fault on the department and its obsession over accessibility and publication. I acknowledge their importance but also challenge the design community’s priorities. Those are the reasons why I hear faculty members implying that WOC’s traumas have to be publicized or disseminated to a wider audience in order to be successful—or that multilingual WOC should do extra labor to accommodate for English speakers.
                    What then is the point of being in class and this institution, when I don’t have a community to support my ideas and research? Crit and class become time wasted without any benefit or expended effort into proving your value to white peers. I wish students and faculty were forced to confront their discomfort and ignorance just as I’ve seen so many WOC do, with humility and a willingness to learn.</p>

My race or ethnic identity is not ever included in conversations about BIPOC people, so for a majority of my life and specifically my RISD career, I’ve hidden behind my racial ambiguity. 
                    <br><br>I have always been the only Arab person in all of my classes, so for me, I did not want to perform my ethnic identity in my classes or my critiques, because I never had support or saw myself represented anywhere. Not in the design world, not in 
                    the faculty, not in the student body.

                <p>
                    WOC voices in critique spaces are very often disregarded and not taken seriously, or when we speak up on problematic work, the conversation ends at the end of class and never brought up again, especially when it comes to critiquing the work of White men. 
                    <br><br>We are the ones taking risks when we decide to speak up, but the racial power dynamics in critique spaces often outweigh WOC voices. I think it’s on the faculty to recognize those power dynamics in their classes, and to value WOC voices when we speak up.

                    I teach here. Year after year, my contributions are sidelined or slyly not acknowledged, and my labor, which amounts to killing myself to have a 
                    tenth of the space, is taken as a kind of tithe, an unpleasant fee I need to pay for the proceeds of stepping in the room. 
                    I work constantly to support and mentor the WOC who are erased as in these accounts, to be the one person that hears 
                    and validates them because they’re either being actively undermined or gaslit. 
                    But in the process of doing that work—at least 20-30 hours extra as well—my health has failed multiple times.
                    <br><br>I keep trying to push change and critique, create the accountability culture within faculty as one the few BIPOC women here, but encounter the wall of silence, which leads me to doubt my place, my colleagues’ care, whether they see or hear me at all. There are collea-
                    gues with power who listen, but will not change the culture. Like so many WOC instructors before me at RISD, I have lost the battle which can’t be waged alone.

                    Critique is the psychological battleground where erasure begins, through the disregard of any work to do with difference, of any expression illegible to the white gaze, of whatever doesn’t look like a very specific tradition of “excellence”. Aesthetics and power and notions of genius and mastery are all reinforced in critique. If ten professors are white and in their fifties and have never read a postcolonial theory text or Said or any thinking written after 1990, how can they possibly be anything but violent to young brilliant people from all over the world in their critique? Critique is where faculty who haven’t evolved their views enforce their violence and protect their jobs, and kill risk, and make sure the cycle continues. 
                    <br><br>Maybe most insidious: it’s where the crushing doubt is seeded for WOC, that they 
                    aren’t rigorous, that their work isn’t good, that their work is “inscrutable,” (real story), or that they should be doing this (elevated form in the vein of Dutch design masters), instead of that (oh, critical exploration of culture or history or class or ____.) 
                    Critique is whether whatever joy, pleasure, curiosity, and interest that one had sacrificed home, family, stability to pursue to come to an MFA is overshadowed and erased by the weight of an institution hell-bent at preserving power at all costs.

                    There’s been way too many times where an idea is dumbed down by the class. Voices from different backgrounds have beautiful stories to tell, we must listen and provide space for their context, not everything is inspired by Hollywood, it ain’t the center of the world.

                I would say for people to be more mindful of how much space they take up in critique and in the department in general, because overall this leaks into the graphic design community and stays with us as a culture. 
                <br><br>If you want to take, you need to be able to give, and speaking up in crit for everyone is the first and simplest way to do that. 
                <br><br>I also think faculty should do more to meet students where they are at, and be mindful of their voices, opinions, and biases so that they don’t influence the conversation more than necessary.

                    I don’t often make cultural work, but think a lot about what it would be like if I did. I’m not sure if I’m worried that the work could be considered derivative and unoriginal, or if I’m just worried about having to explain context to people who might not understand. 
                    <br><br>I also didn’t really think I had experienced erasure at first, but the more I think about it, the more the smaller instances have collected. As an Asian American woman, I often feel anxious about taking up space in critique, and think over the comments I’m planning to make over and over before I make them. I’m concerned about being mistaken by a professor for one of my peers, especially in an academic culture where being more outspoken is rewarded with more recognition, even if the outspokenness doesn’t amount to anything substantial. 
                    <br><br>I’ve noticed this culture also persists to the professional graphic design community, and it is disappointing to think this could be the reality for the rest of my working life.

                    I think my experiences have gotten generally better since entering the department, but the culture of foundation year definitely contributes to the problem. I don’t believe the fear that foundation year faculty sometimes use to control the situation is accomplishing anything, and the culture of teaching students to expect to get burnt out (the sink or swim mentality) is helpful to anyone. I’ve slowly seen things get better as my time in the institution has passed, but I also think it’s due to the power dynamics of older students and faculty getting a bit more evened out. Having to deal with the toxic dynamic of crit spaces when you first enter the institution is extremely formative though, and definitely puts you on edge for the rest of your time here.

                I don’t know about erasure, but I can definitely talk about disregard. The latter being much more harmful than the former for it carries an active practice of ignorance and lack of acknowledgement.  
                <br><br>Being a WOC has not been easy, especially when you don’t directly come from the American context. I and my ideas, on multiple occasions, have been either overlooked or talked over just because I did not speak them as boldly as my male counterparts. 
                <br><br>I feel necessitated to code-switch just to present myself as worthy and equal. On occasions when I try and talk about my country, I can see silence take over the room with no active participation from my peers. Sometimes when my ideas are not “American” enough, I have seen preference be given those whose are. I wouldn’t call this erasure because it hasn’t completely taken away my will to present my notions, however, I will say I have been made to feel invisible and a mere glitch in system.

                    If you obliterate someone’s will to talk about ideas they want to talk about or take the space away from them, then you force them to tune to your channel and I would call that oppression. This problem exists not only in GD but is prevalent across other departments.
